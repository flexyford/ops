# TrueCoach Ops

A collection of DevOps-style config, automation scripts, etc, for use across TrueCoach apps.

## Contributing

Contributions via pull request are welcome!

We prefer scripts written in languages we use heavily in our apps, e.g. Ruby, rather than
Bash, Sh, etc, whenever possible. This allows a wider range of developers to contribute more
easily.

## TODO

- [ ] Tests for CircleCI scripts
